## Refresh models on login to use internet connection

## Model distribution pipeline
The sdk will download the classification model depending on the device position or a manual selection of a specific model id.
The classification model will be stored on the device. So the download ist needed only once and will be started on the first start of the classification.
The model file is very small of size. It's about 100 KB. So there will be not storage issues on the device.
